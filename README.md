# Prediction using Supervised ML
Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn (Level - Beginner)

Task Description:

Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.


Dataset:

The dataset student_scores_student_scores.csv contains two columns: Hours (number of study hours) and Scores (percentage score).


Steps:

1. Importing all necessary libraries.
2. Loading the dataset and displaying its contents.
3. Plotting the distribution of scores.
4. Dividing attributes (inputs) and labels (outputs).
5. Splitting the dataset into a test set and a train set.
6. Training the linear regression model.
7. Plotting the regression line.
8. Testing the model and predicting scores.
9. Evaluating the model using mean absolute error.

   
Required Libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
  

Prediction:

What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?
The predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours/day is displayed.
