# Prediction using Supervised ML

Linear Regression with Python Scikit Learn (Level - Beginner)

Task Description:

Predict the percentage of a student based on the number of study hours.


Dataset:

The dataset student_scores_student_scores.csv contains two columns: Hours (number of study hours) and Scores (percentage score).


Steps:

1. Importing all necessary libraries.
2. Loading the dataset and displaying its contents.
3. Plotting the distribution of scores.
4. Dividing attributes (inputs) and labels (outputs).
5. Splitting the dataset into a test set and a train set.
6. Training the linear regression model.
7. Plotting the regression line.
8. Testing the model and predicting scores.
9. Evaluating the model using mean absolute error.

   
Required Libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn
  

Prediction:

What will be predicted score if a student studies for 9.25 hrs/day?
The predicted score for a student studying 9.25 hours/day is displayed.

# Prediction using Unsupervised ML
# K-Means Clustering (Level - Beginner)

Task Description:

From the given ‘Iris’ dataset, predict the optimum number of clusters and represent it visually.


Dataset:

The Iris dataset contains four features: sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width.


Steps:

1. Importing all necessary libraries.
2. Loading the dataset and displaying its contents.
3. Finding the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method.
4. Creating a K-means classifier with the chosen number of clusters.
5. Visualizing the clusters on the first two columns.


Required Libraries:

- pandas
- numpy
- matplotlib
- sklearn


Optimum Number of Clusters:

Based on the elbow method, the optimum number of clusters is chosen as 3.
